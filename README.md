This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript event listeners within HTML. Unhandled exceptions within the event listener's callback function can prevent the listener from functioning correctly without providing any clear error messages in the console. This often leads to debugging challenges as the code appears to execute without errors, but the desired functionality is not working. The provided solution focuses on robust error handling to prevent this silent failure.
